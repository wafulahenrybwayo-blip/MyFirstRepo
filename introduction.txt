Brief Introduction About Myself

Hello, my name is Henry. I am detail-oriented, strategic, and passionate about learning and applying concepts in statistics, finance, and product design. I enjoy breaking down complex ideas into clear, actionable formats like tables and flowcharts.

Beyond academics, basketball plays a big role in shaping my discipline and teamwork. I am also exploring self-directed investing and skincare routines, always aiming for practical, budget-friendly solutions.
